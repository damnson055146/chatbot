FR-UP2: The frontend shall request short-lived signed URLs, upload files directly to storage, then call the backend with metadata (filename, mime type, sha256, page count) so ingestion/OCR pipelines can run.  
FR-UP3: All uploads shall pass antivirus and PII scans as described in IR_TP055146; audit logs must record uploader identity, purpose, retention selection, and counsellor access history.  
FR-UP4: Attachments shall appear inside the context rail with previews (page thumbnails or extracted slot hints) so counsellors can reference them mid-session.  
FR-UP5: Retention defaults to 30 days unless the user explicitly opts to save artefacts; deletion requests shall purge hot storage, backups, and analytics copies.  

### 3.9 Internationalization & Accessibility â€?Status: Not Started

## 4. External Interfaces



### 4.1 API (FastAPI) â€?Status: In Progress

- `POST /api/query` â€?body: { text, lang, slots? } â†?returns: { answer, citations[], diagnostics }  

- `POST /api/ingest` â€?body: { file/url, meta } â†?returns: { doc_id }  

- `POST /api/reindex` â€?body: { scope } â†?returns: { job_id }  

- `GET /api/health` â€?returns: status, build info, index metrics.



### 4.2 SiliconFlow â€?Status: Completed

- Endpoint: `POST /v1/chat/completions` (Bearer auth). Controls: `model`, `temperature`, `top_p`, `stop`, `stream`, etc. Error/429 handling with retry/backoff. îˆ€citeîˆ‚turn0search10îˆ‚turn0search5îˆ?



### 4.3 Admin UI â€?Status: Not Started

- Source CRUD, prompt editor, slot schema editor, feature flags (reranker on/off), dashboards.



---



## 5. Nonâ€‘Functional Requirements (NFRs)



### 5.1 Performance & SLOs â€?Status: In Progress

- P50/P95 latencies (desktop on campus network):  

  - Retrieval â‰?300/800 ms; Rerank â‰?300/900 ms; Generation first token â‰?1.5/3 s; E2E â‰?3/7 s.  

- Index builds: incremental update < 10 min for 5k pages; full rebuild overnight windows.

> Rationale: Hybrid retrieval + rerank improves relevance; streaming/composable pipeline controls tail latency. îˆ€citeîˆ‚turn0search7îˆ‚turn0search1îˆ?



### 5.2 Reliability & Availability

- 99.5% monthly availability for query path; graceful degradation (no reranker â†?still answer with warnings).  

- Idempotent ingest jobs; atâ€‘leastâ€‘once reindex with dedupe.



### 5.3 Security & Privacy (PDPA)

- Consent & notice for any personal data in conversations; store minimal necessary data.  

- Security principle: protect personal data from loss/misuse/unauthorized access.  

- Retention principle: do not keep data longer than necessary; configurable retention (e.g., 30/90 days). îˆ€citeîˆ‚turn0search13îˆ‚turn0search17îˆ? 

- Log redaction; no sensitive fields in analytics.  

- Access control: roleâ€‘based (admin/counsellor/viewer); API keys rotated and leastâ€‘privilege.  

- Data residency: choose regionâ€‘appropriate storage if required by institution policy.  

- Thirdâ€‘party: SiliconFlow & other services documented with DPAs where applicable.  

> Background: Malaysia PDPA in force; follow 7 principles (notice/choice, disclosure, security, retention, data integrity, access). îˆ€citeîˆ‚turn0search4îˆ‚turn0search17îˆ?



### 5.4 Maintainability & Modularity -- Status: In Progress

- Components (ingest/index/query/rerank/generate) deployable independently.  

- Configuration via ENV/`configs/*.yaml`; no secrets in repo.  

- Manifest, prompt, and document lookup caches reduce disk churn; multi-worker persistence deemed out of scope for the current release.  



### 5.5 Observability -- Status: In Progress

- Delivered ingestion phase timers and reranker counter metrics (2025-11-02).  

- Metrics: latency, error rate, empty-hit rate, rerank coverage, citation count, API retries.  

- Reranker resilience telemetry: `rerank_retry::*`, `rerank_circuit::*`, `rerank_fallback::*` expose retry counts, circuit state, and fallback frequency for dashboards.  

- Tracing: request id spans through retrieval¡úrerank¡úgeneration.  

- Logs: structured JSON with correlation ids.  

- Next: publish dashboard templates and OTLP tracing runbooks (metrics exporter deferred).  



### 5.6 Compatibility â€?Status: Not Started

- Browsers: latest Chrome/Edge/Safari/Firefox; responsive mobile web.  

- API stability: semantic versioning for public endpoints.



---



## 6. Data Requirements â€?Status: In Progress



DRâ€?: Store only necessary session data (query text, slots, selected citations, minimal diagnostics).  

DRâ€?: Pseudonymize session ids; purge per retention policy; allow export/delete upon request. îˆ€citeîˆ‚turn0search13îˆ? 

DRâ€?: Content store keeps original docs, chunked texts, embeddings, and metadata with versioning.  

DRâ€?: Maintain provenance for every chunk (URL, title, section, timestamp).



---



## 7. Constraints, Assumptions, Dependencies



- **Constraints**: budget (cloud API usage), institutional firewalls, content licenses; rely on SiliconFlow availability limits. îˆ€citeîˆ‚turn0search10îˆ? 

- **Assumptions**: curated sources are permitted for indexing; admins keep corpus upâ€‘toâ€‘date.  

- **Dependencies**: vector DB (Milvus/Qdrant/FAISS), lexical index, object storage; Rasa optional for guided forms. îˆ€citeîˆ‚turn0search3îˆ? 

- **Prototype Support**: Dify used for prototyping/ops integration where helpful. îˆ€citeîˆ‚turn0search2îˆ?



---



## 8. Acceptance Criteria (Samples)



- Given an eligibility query with complete slots, the system returns an answer â‰?5 s with â‰?2 citations linking to the correct passages.  

- When reranker is disabled, the system still returns a grounded answer with a â€œreducedâ€‘confidenceâ€?banner.  

- For a changed policy (updated doc), a nightly refresh reflects new content and citations within 24 h.  

- Admin can upload a new PDF, trigger reindex, and see it cited in results.  

- PDPA: a user can request deletion of their session data; system confirms purge within SLA.

- Streaming queries invoked with `/v1/query?stream=true` emit incremental tokens within 0.5 s, and the client stop button cancels the stream without leaving orphaned tasks.  

- Pinned or archived conversations remain available after page refresh for authenticated users (server persistence) and for the current browser when unauthenticated.

- Uploaded PDFs/images show scans completed state before submission, are referenceable in the context rail, and honor the default 30-day retention (auto purge upon delete requests).



---



## 9. Test Plan Outline â€?Status: In Progress



- Unit: ingestion parsers, chunker, retriever, reranker mock, citation mapper.  

- Integration: endâ€‘toâ€‘end query with stubbed SiliconFlow, then with live key (rateâ€‘limited).  

- Data QA: citation targets match passages; broken links alerting.  

- NFR: latency benchmarks with corpora sizes (S/M/L); chaos tests for reranker outage.  

- Security: authZ, rateâ€‘limit, log redaction, retention purge jobs.



---



## 10. Roadmap & Milestones (suggested) â€?Status: In Progress



- M1 (Week 1â€?): Corpus curation + ingest pipeline; baseline dense retrieval; SiliconFlow integration.  

- M2 (Week 3â€?): Hybrid retrieval + citations; bilingual UI; admin basics.  

- M3 (Week 5â€?): Reranker + observability; PDPA data controls; nightly refresh.  

- M4 (Week 7â€?): Guided forms/slots; quality review; UX polish; pilot.
